# 43. Project - Voice Assistant with VAPI

## Overview

This module documents building a voice assistant using VAPI and n8n. The goal is a multi-agent voice workflow where the VAPI assistant uses custom tools backed by n8n webhooks and agent logic.

Key concepts:
- Voice assistant frontend in VAPI
- Backend automation in n8n
- Agent-as-a-tool architecture
- Tool definitions for availability checks and booking
- Streaming call flow and debugging

## Architecture

1. VAPI assistant is created in the VAPI console with an identity prompt and tools.
2. Custom tools in VAPI call n8n webhook endpoints.
3. n8n workflows receive tool calls, execute calendar and booking operations, and return structured responses.
4. VAPI handles the voice/chat interface and lets the assistant decide when to use tools.

## Setup: VAPI Account and Assistant

- Create a VAPI account and claim the free credit ($10 at time of recording).
- Build a new assistant, e.g. `YT Assistant`.
- Choose provider/model settings: OpenAI GPT-4 cluster or similar.
- Set a system prompt for assistant personality and behavior.

Example prompt notes:
- Friendly and professional receptionist for a dental clinic
- Responsible for booking appointments efficiently
- Can ask for user name, phone number, and preferred time
- Must use tools to confirm availability and book slots

## Adding Tools to VAPI

### Custom tool: Get Availability

- Create a custom tool called `get availability tool`.
- Use `date` as a string parameter.
- Provide a description that explains the user input examples: `tomorrow 3-4pm`, `25th October`, `2-3pm`.
- Set the tool to call the n8n webhook production URL.
- Configure a short timeout (20 seconds recommended).

### Custom tool: Booking Tool

- Create a second tool called `booking tool`.
- Define parameters such as `date` and `name`.
- Add clear descriptions so the assistant can send the right data.
- Set the webhook server URL to the booking workflow endpoint.
- Keep credential handling in mind: this demo uses open testing mode, but production needs proper auth.

### Important workflow detail

- Publish the tool after changes. VAPI tool definitions do not take effect until published.
- If the assistant appears unable to call the tool, publishing is the first debugging step.

## n8n Workflow Design

### Core nodes

- `Webhook` node(s): accept tool calls from VAPI.
- `AI Agent` node(s): process incoming requests and call tools or downstream services.
- `Google Gemini Chat Model`: provides the LLM used by the agent.
- `Simple Memory` buffer: keeps short-term conversational context.
- `Google Calendar Tool`: checks availability and can book events.
- `Structured Output Parser`: formats tool responses for the agent.
- `Respond to Webhook`: returns responses to VAPI.

### Multi-agent and sub-agent pattern

- Use n8n agents as backend tools for VAPI.
- The VAPI assistant calls a webhook tool, which in turn may delegate to other n8n agents.
- This forms a multi-agent architecture where the main voice assistant uses smaller booking or availability agents as tools.

## Workflow Example

1. User says: `Can you book an appointment for tomorrow at 5 p.m.`
2. VAPI assistant asks for name and phone number.
3. Assistant decides to call `get availability tool` with the requested date/time.
4. n8n webhook receives the tool call, queries calendar availability, and returns a structured response.
5. VAPI agent decides next steps based on availability.
6. If available, the assistant may call `booking tool` or ask the user to confirm details.

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

- Tool changes not published in VAPI.
- Workflows not active in n8n.
- Incorrect webhook URL or missing query data.
- VAPI insufficient tool parameter schema.
- No result returned from n8n due to runtime or parsing errors.

### Debugging steps

- Verify the VAPI tool has the correct production webhook URL.
- Confirm the n8n workflow is active and reachable.
- Check VAPI execution logs for tool call attempts.
- Check n8n execution logs for webhook requests and response payloads.
- Ensure the agent output parser schema matches the expected response format.

## Demo and Lessons Learned

### Execution flow

- The assistant can successfully ask for the user's details.
- The tool call may be visible in VAPI execution logs with a body containing the webhook URL and tool arguments.
- The booking flow should route through the backend n8n workflow.

### Practical observations

- Getting the voice call end-to-end requires stable tooling and may still fail due to platform-specific issues.
- The agent can still be tested through the VAPI chat interface before using live voice.
- Additional debugging is often needed when a request reaches VAPI but not the n8n webhook.

## Best Practices

- Use explicit tool definitions with clear parameter names.
- Keep the assistant prompt grounded with tool usage instructions.
- Publish tool definitions after every update.
- Use n8n webhooks as the backend integration point for VAPI.
- Build using the agent-as-a-tool mindset: let the voice assistant orchestrate tool calls instead of hardcoding logic.

## Key Takeaways

- VAPI can function as a voice front end for n8n backend automation.
- Custom tools bridge VAPI assistant actions to webhook-based workflows.
- A multi-agent architecture increases flexibility and makes the voice assistant extensible.
- Publishing and activation are critical steps to make the integration work.
- Logging both VAPI and n8n execution traces is essential for troubleshooting.

## Next steps

- Add more tools for email, Google Sheets, SMS, or booking confirmations.
- Secure the webhook endpoints with authentication.
- Improve the assistant prompt to handle more conversational booking scenarios.
- Add retries and fallback handling for tool call failures.
